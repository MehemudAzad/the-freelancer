@Table(name = "reviews")
public class Review {
    private Long id;
    private Long gigId;
    private Long freelancerId;
    private Long reviewerId;
    private String jobId;
    private String contractId;
    
    // Rating categories (1-5)
    private Integer overallRating;
    private Integer qualityRating;
    private Integer communicationRating;
    private Integer timelinessRating;
    private Integer professionalismRating;
    
    // Review content
    private String title;
    private String comment;
    private Boolean wouldRecommend;
    
    // Metadata
    private ReviewStatus status;
    private Boolean isAnonymous;

    private String flagReason;
    private Integer helpfulVotes;
    private String freelancerResponse;
    
    private LocalDateTime createdAt;
    private LocalDateTime updatedAt;
}
```

### DTOs

#### ReviewCreateDto
```java
public class ReviewCreateDto {
    @NotNull private Long gigId;
    @NotNull private Long freelancerId;
    private String jobId;
    private String contractId;
    
    @NotNull @Min(1) @Max(5) private Integer overallRating;
    @NotNull @Min(1) @Max(5) private Integer qualityRating;
    @NotNull @Min(1) @Max(5) private Integer communicationRating;
    @NotNull @Min(1) @Max(5) private Integer timelinessRating;
    @NotNull @Min(1) @Max(5) private Integer professionalismRating;
    
    @Size(max = 100) private String title;
    @NotBlank @Size(max = 2000) private String comment;
    private String reviewType = "GIG_REVIEW";
    private Boolean isAnonymous = false;
    private Boolean wouldRecommend = true;
}
```

#### ReviewSummaryDto
```java
public class ReviewSummaryDto {
    private Long totalReviews;
    private Double averageRating;
    private Double recommendationPercentage;
    
    // Category averages
    private Double averageQualityRating;
    private Double averageCommunicationRating;
    private Double averageTimelinessRating;
    private Double averageProfessionalismRating;
    
    // Recent metrics
    private Long recentReviews;
    private Double recentAverageRating;
    
    // Distribution
    private Map<Integer, Long> ratingDistribution;
}
```

## Business Logic

### Review Creation Process
1. **Validation**: Verify gig exists and user permissions
2. **Duplicate Check**: Ensure reviewer hasn't already reviewed this gig
3. **Rating Calculation**: Calculate overall rating from categories
4. **Auto-Publication**: Most reviews are automatically published
5. **Rating Updates**: Update both gig and profile ratings

### Rating Aggregation
```java
// Overall rating calculation (equal weight to all categories)
overallRating = (qualityRating + communicationRating + 
                timelinessRating + professionalismRating) / 4.0

// Gig rating update (average of all reviews)
gigRating = SUM(overallRating) / COUNT(reviews)

// Profile rating update (average across all gigs)
profileRating = AVG(gigRatings weighted by review count)
```

### Automatic Updates
- **Gig Ratings**: Updated immediately when reviews are created/updated
- **Profile Ratings**: Updated via ProfileService integration
- **Review Counts**: Maintained on both Gig and Profile entities

## Database Schema

### Indexes for Performance
```sql
-- Review lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_gig_reviews ON reviews(gig_id, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_freelancer_reviews ON reviews(freelancer_id, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_reviewer_reviews ON reviews(reviewer_id, created_at);

-- Rating queries
CREATE INDEX idx_gig_rating ON reviews(gig_id, overall_rating);
CREATE INDEX idx_freelancer_rating ON reviews(freelancer_id, overall_rating);

-- Status filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_review_status ON reviews(status, created_at);
```

### Constraints
```sql
-- Ensure rating values are within valid range
ALTER TABLE reviews ADD CONSTRAINT check_overall_rating 
    CHECK (overall_rating >= 1 AND overall_rating <= 5);

-- Prevent duplicate reviews per gig/reviewer
ALTER TABLE reviews ADD CONSTRAINT unique_gig_reviewer 
    UNIQUE (gig_id, reviewer_id);
```
